# Blog

This blog project uses the MVC conception architectural pattern using the OOP paradigm to make it run.

Therefore the project also uses a framework made from scratch and built with PHP. The framework is 
composed of three sections (Model, View, Controller) that divide the code, so that we may obtain a clear 
code while optimizing the simplicity for future maintenance.

It also uses the AJAX concept to exchange data between the server and the application, and exchanges are
crypted using the AES script tool, ok it is experimental :-), but it's still works, even if it can be improved ...

At the end, the exchange of data is protected against XSS attack.

/!\ Notice : To run this project, you may find the DB in the "DB" folder
